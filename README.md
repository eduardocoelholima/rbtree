# rbtree
A C++ Implementation of a Red-Black Tree Data Structure

We based our implementation on the pseudocode of Cormen's book and used sentynels for avoiding invalid accesses to null pointers. A win32 executable is provided, compiled with mingw.

- RBTree.hpp
- RBTree.cpp
- main.cpp (a test program that instantiates RBTree)
- dicionario1.txt (a test dictionary with insert/delete commands)
